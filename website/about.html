      <h2>How it Works</h2>
      <p>MailScrape is made up of two basic components, A chrome extension, and 
         a python application. The chrome extension retrieves your emails and
         sends them to the python app, which will then scan them for any links.
         If a link is found it will query the link against a database of know malicious 
         emails. Your emails are not sent anywhere, only the links found within are.
